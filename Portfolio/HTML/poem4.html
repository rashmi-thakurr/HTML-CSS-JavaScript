                When I sat to write<br>
                This interplay of words and rhythm<br>
                Or to fly this lyrical kite<br>
                Or to play with illusionary prism<br>
                I didn't know<br>
                Where musical winds will blow<br>
                I didn't know<br>
                How this poem will go<br><br>

                my ideas ,my thoughts, my notions<br>
                The petals of my flowering emotions<br>
                That tenanted my body and head<br>
                Not one or ten but hundred<br>
                Some lively while others dead<br>
                Be it completely grown<br>
                Like a decaying fleshless bone<br>
                Or a developing new bud<br>
                As flood of a young blood<br>
                Magenta, violet, velvet or red<br>
                Oh I understand that<br>
                From this thoughtful rainbow<br>
                I had to chose one glow<br>
                But, I didn't know<br>
                How this poem will go<br>

                You name it,<br>
                Anything that your brain emit<br>
                A mystery , a tragedy,<br>
                Or hunger well fed by money<br>
                Or for instance<br>
                That raindrop eternal dance<br>
                Or about a ruined chance<br>
                Or affection, love and romance<br>
                Portraying exchanged glance<br>
                Something suspicious or thriller<br>
                My poem as a story teller<br>
                Or about my mother's smell<br>
                Or my fondness for father<br>
                Or a thing that ring humour bells<br>
                Different themes that I could gather<br>
                Which one to chose<br>
                And the one I use<br>
                To all left, a big no<br>
                All were the arrows and me one bow<br>
                Yes, I wanted my feelings to flow<br>
                Again, I didn't know<br>
                How this poem will go<br>
