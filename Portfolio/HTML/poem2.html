            <h3 class="poem-content para-1" style="height: fit-content;">Whose rose this is, I think I know<br>
                For whom and by whom<br>
                Just like the other ones<br>
                You left, and i found out of my room<br>
                I never saw you, you assume<br>
                Dear, I saw them, in your eyes<br>
                In the ways you looked at me<br>
                As I was the only one to see<br>
                Manifested a lot,<br>
                that even your roses can't<br>
                But you'll never tell me that <br>
                You're highly dependent on that plant<br>
                 mysterious roses shall tell, you presume<br>
                But their scent reached me<br>
                Even before they got their perfume
                <br>
                But I'm Sorry<br>
                The ones which were meant to bloom<br>
                Will die very soon<br>
               
            </h3>
              <h3 class="poem-content para-2"style="height: fit-content;">  
                And you shall be blaming me<br>
                For their deaths<br>
                But, <br>
                I can love your roses all day and night<br>
                I can love your love<br>
                I can love you for your love<br>
                But i can't hold your hand<br>
                My love for you, you won't understand<br>
                 loving you is an ability I lack<br>
                I'm sorry, I can't love you back<br>
                If I could, <br>
                I will make me love you<br>
                In a way you want me to<br>
                 but I can't, you know that <br>
                So for the last time, i'll let the roses cry<br>
                You'll think, I killed the roses<br>
                Really will I? <br>
                Yes, I shall let them die<br>
