                Let's go to a world<br>
                Different from this one<br>
                Not mine, nor yours<br>
                It belongs to none...<br>
                Where you define perfections<br>
                Your imaginations, your creations<br>
                Where you can paint sky to be green<br>
                Or make the grass blue<br>
                The way you want it to be seen<br>
                But i don't have a clue<br>
                Will you go there? Will you?<br>
                Well, i don't have a clue<br>
                Will you go there? Will you?<br>
                I went to my garden<br>
                And sung to the roses<br>
                "Will you come with me? Will you?"<br>
                "Well, I want to go there too"<br>
                That was daisy, whom I forgot,<br>
                "Count me in",<br>
                Otherwise upset, seemed excited a lot,<br>
                Wished to rock that stupid world<br>
                I asked her, "so excited, why?"<br>
                And there, came the reply,<br>
                "I want to be lived in a world, that's perfect,<br>
                 Where my desires and qualities intersect,<br>
                What I wish is what I get,<br>
                There, I'd paint my petals red,<br>
                And bend them a little,<br>
                And I'll be changed overnight<br>
                Then I'd be nearly a rose,<br>
              
               
                
               <br></h3>
            <h3 class="poem-content para-2"  style="height:fit-content;">
                 That you will choose<br>
                For which you will sing<br>
                And write prose"<br>
                That was what perfect world to her meant<br>
                Where her petals are red and bent<br>
                But I was so ignorant,<br>
                I didn't have a clue,<br>
                That Daisy wants me too<br>
                That Daisy was beautiful<br>
                But she was insecure too<br>
                I took the daisy pot<br>
                To take her to a new world<br>
                May be not the world she meant<br>
                Where her petals are red and bent<br>
                But the world I wanted to show<br>
                Where "ugly" flowers too grow<br>
                That she didn't know<br>
                I kept her beside a thorny cactus<br>
                And there she was, most beautiful daisy<br>
                With her petals white and straight<br>
                that was best world to her till date<br>
                She looked at cactus and sigh<br>
                Asked him, "How long do you survive? "<br>
                And then I knew<br>
                She was comparing again too<br>
                May be daisy didn't understand<br>
                But I did, I definitely did<br>
                The idea of perfection is absurd<br>
                When you leave your insecurities<br>
                That's your perfect world<br>
