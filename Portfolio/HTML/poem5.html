                One Silent Garden,The silent garden<br>
                A wind whispered,<br>
                For a moment,<br>
                Leaves Rattled, Doors Creaked<br>
                Curtains Danced in Pain<br>
                Then it all went silent again<br>
                But not the chaos inside me<br>
                But I wasn't alone, may be<br>
                Who wanted to hear<br>
                Splash! Of the silent pond<br>
                Him too<br>
                Standing correct and straight<br>
                To whom I could relate<br>
                Green on top, brown bottom<br>
                He tried fighting silent problem<br>
                To silence the noise of silence<br>
                Which is scariest to some<br>
                Including me and him<br>
                He was full of songs<br>
                With the wind clatter<br>
                His many brown hands chattered<br>
                As they moved up and down<br>
                Leaves hissed, mainly green<br>
                And some yellow and brown<br>
                Felt, that song is for me<br>
                
               </h3>
            <h3 class="poem-content para-2" style="height:fit-content;">
                That day he was a free bee<br>
                Though he was just a tree<br>
                Restless was him and silent was me.<br>
                But today it's all different<br>
                Today he is silent, and me<br>
                The explicit, the noisy<br>
                And that noise in and out of me<br>
                Grows immensely<br>
                As his silence grows silently<br>
                I am terrified,<br>
                Maybe for my noisy cry<br>
                Maybe for his silence<br>
                Or may be for both<br>
                I kept watching and waiting<br>
                Silently,<br>
                For him to sing,<br>
                For his green bells to ring<br>
                But not a word came<br>
                May be he waited for the same<br>
                One silent garden, The silent garden<br>
                As I was leaving,<br>
                Leaves Rattled,<br>
                And my door creaked,<br>
                And then<br>
                Silence Again.<br> -Rashmi:))<br></h3>
