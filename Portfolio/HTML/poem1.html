      <div class="poem" style="display: flex;">
        
            <h3 class="poem-content para-1" style="height: 550px;">With everyone, i was so alone<br>
                Strange thoughts and feelings unknown<br>
                Thinking about someone,<br>
                Not anyone but you<br>
                The way I felt for you,<br> 
                You felt that way for her<br>
                When my eyes followed you<br>
                Just to find yours chasing her<br>
                Now I realise that I never realised<br>
                That made me "the other girl"<br>
                When others told me<br>
                How beautiful is my smile<br>
                You didn't even notice it<br>
                Not even for a while<br>
                That beauty is gone, that smile is gone<br>
                Tears in eyes and vision is blur<br>
                And you were so busy<br>
                Adoring her hairs and curls<br>
                Now I realise that I never realised<br>
                That made me "the other girl"<br>
                That's crazy, i was so happy <br>
                Whenever we talked<br>
                But it was always about her<br>
            </h3>
              <h3 class="poem-content para-2" style="height: 550px;">  
                And all i did, smiled<br>
                Hoping that you'll notice someday<br>
                Not my smile, but what my eyes tried to say<br>
                See, I am smiling<br>
                But somewhere deeper, I am dying<br>
                But you couldn't tell ever<br>
                That I love you<br> 
                I love you but you love her<br>
                Now I realise that I never realised<br>
                That made me "the other girl"<br>
                I want to tell you<br> 
                But I am afraid of the ways<br>
                Ways in which you'll react<br>
                Ways in which you'll reject<br>
                I don't have courage to face<br>
                My feelings may be called mistake<br>
                But my emotions aren't my fault<br>
                It's not my fault, I fell for you<br>
                And Dear, You have no idea<br>
                How much this "other girl" loves you<br>
