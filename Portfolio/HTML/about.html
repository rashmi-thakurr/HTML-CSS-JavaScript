        <p>
            Hey! I'm Rashmi.<br>
            <br>
            I am an undergraduate student at IIT Delhi,majoring in Textile Science and Fibre Engineering. 
            During my stay at IIT Delhi, I have developed a passion for Web-Development and Software Development.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have worked as web-development intern at Redopact Private Limited, an early stage startup, developing an e-commerce web platform.
            <br>
            <br>
            In my free time,i try to understand human psychology. Human emotions, people, figuring out why they behave the way they behave interests me.
            I also love to write poems, whenever i find myself high on emotions. That's my way of handling things which aren't under my control.
