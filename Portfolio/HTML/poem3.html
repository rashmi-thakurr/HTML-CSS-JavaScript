                It not just happened, i did it<br>
                I ask, "But why?"<br>
                Not just came off, I admit<br>
                I cry, "but why?"<br>
                Cluelessly crazy, sufficiently stupid<br>
                And so was I, and so was I<br>
                I am dumb enough to argue,<br>
                About this nuisance , nothing new<br>
                I had no such plan<br>
                I question it ,as much as I can<br>
                It happened once, faulty first<br>
                It was mine mistake and will burst<br>
                Error's essence , I ever smelled<br>
                But those grating cries of the crows<br>
                Yelled and said<br>
                What if, sown seed grows??<br>
                Oh yes, and then<br>

                A series of mistaken act<br>
                That I just could't control<br>
                Couldn't exit even, a filthy fact<br>
                Knowing of the messy end<br>
                Sown seeds will raise cactus<br>
                And those weeds of sand<br>
                Stings my body, my hand<br>
                I wish, I dream,<br>
                If I could make it alright<br>
                Return me that moonless night<br>
                From where it happened to start<br>
                From where it began to fall apart<br>
                But I realise ,<br>
                This can only be true<br>
                When sun stops to shine<br>
                And sky is no more blue . - Rashmi<br>
